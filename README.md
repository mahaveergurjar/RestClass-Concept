# REST Class Concepts in Node.js

This README provides an overview of REST class concepts in Node.js, covering key aspects and practices for building RESTful APIs in Node.js.

## Introduction
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. In Node.js, RESTful APIs are commonly built to enable communication between clients and servers using HTTP methods.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Express.js
Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js, which provides robust routing, middleware, and other features needed to build RESTful APIs efficiently.

### 2. Routing
Routing in Express.js defines how an application responds to client requests to particular endpoints (URLs) and HTTP methods.

### 3. Middleware
Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that have access to the request and response objects, and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. Middleware functions can perform tasks such as logging, authentication, and error handling.

### 4. HTTP Methods
RESTful APIs typically utilize standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

### 5. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used for exchanging data between a client and a server in RESTful APIs.

### 6. CRUD Operations
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are the basic operations that a RESTful API performs on resources. Each HTTP method corresponds to a CRUD operation.

## Getting Started
To get started with building RESTful APIs in Node.js, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already.
2. Create a new Node.js project directory.
3. Initialize the project using `npm init` command and follow the prompts.
4. Install Express.js and any other necessary dependencies using npm.
5. Create your Express.js application and define routes, middleware, and logic for handling API requests.
6. Test your API using tools like Postman or curl.
7. Deploy your Node.js application to a hosting platform or server.

## Example Code
Here's a simple example demonstrating how to create a basic RESTful API using Express.js:
